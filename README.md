# 🎨 Cover Craft

**A Design-First, Full-Stack Monorepo engineered for Reliability, Accessibility, and Scale.**

Cover Craft is a cloud-native platform that bridges the gap between creative automation and rigorous system design. It demonstrates professional engineering standards by enforcing **WCAG AA accessibility compliance** and **data privacy** through its core architecture. Built as a TypeScript monorepo, it prioritizes engineering velocity and type safety, ensuring a stable and maintainable foundation from inception to launch.

## 🧭 Engineering Principles

- **🎨 Shift-Left Accessibility:** Automated WCAG AA contrast validation is baked into the generation pipeline, preventing inaccessible output by design.
- **🔒 Privacy by Design:** A zero-data architecture with no cookies, no tracking, and no persistence, ensuring complete user anonymity.
- **🖼️ Stateless Reliability:** Server-side rendering via Azure Functions ensures consistent visual fidelity and cross-platform rendering accuracy.
- **📊 Privacy-First Observability:** Structured, anonymized telemetry provides system insights and performance monitoring without compromising user privacy.
